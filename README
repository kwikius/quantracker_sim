PC simulator for my Antenna Tracker with a GUI to move the aircraft around
 and send the simulated GPS info to the Tracker.

See http://www.zoomworks.org/fpv/antenna_tracker/index.html for more about info about the Tracker.
See https://github.com/kwikius/mavlink_to_frsky for the airborne part of the project.
See https://github.com/kwikius/quantracker for sourcode for the tracker part of the project

The code is written in C++11 , so you will need gcc4.7 or above to compile and build.

Currently builds for Linux only.

Release notes

       Now requires wxWidgets 3.x
Bugs
       In Ubuntu you may need to Disable Overlay scrollbars, as overlay scrollbars dont seem to appear.
       Using Thumbtrack or arrows doesnt work correctly (Just needs TODO the requisite handlers)

Other dependencies:
 
	wxWidgets http://www.wxwidgets.org/ 
	my quan library:  https://github.com/kwikius/quan-trunk
