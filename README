PC simulator for my Antenna Tracker with a GUI to move the aircraft around
 and send the simulated GPS info to the Tracker.

See http://www.zoomworks.org/fpv/antenna_tracker/index.html for more about info about the Tracker.
See https://github.com/kwikius/mavlink_to_frsky for the airborne part of the project.
See https://github.com/kwikius/quantracker for sourcode for the tracker part of the project

The code is written in C++11 , so you will need gcc4.7 or above to compile and build.

Currently builds for Linux only.
